# SPS Belts

Your SPS python journey mirrors a martial art. You will travel at your own pace, but to progress from one belt to the next you must prove to your teacher that you've learned the material. You will be asked to prove your knowledge and capabilities - and these steps will generally include reference to previous belts.  

1. [White Belt](white): New Beginning  
An introduction to Python and some tools to help you start your journey: a simple program editor and the basic structure of a Python program. 
1. [Yellow Belt](yellow): Curiosity  
How to plan solutions to problems, making decisions and how to more easily share your code - with your teacher and with yourself, e.g. at home or on a mobile device
1. [Orange Belt](orange): Determination  
How to collect data together to make it more usable, but also how to be better at fixing problems that occur while writing code.
