# SPS Belts

Your SPS python journey mirrors a martial art. You will travel at your own pace, but to progress from one belt to the next you must prove to your teacher that you've learned the material. You will be asked to prove your knowledge and capabilities - and these steps will generally include reference to previous belts.  

It is perfectly feasible that you will not get to the end of this belt system, by design the [brown](brown), [black](black), and especially [red](red), levels are for those who wish to extend themselves, probably looking to do Computing at A Level, and possibly at university. 

## The Belts

1. [White Belt](white): New Beginning  
An introduction to Python and some tools to help you start your journey: a simple program editor and the basic structure of a Python program. 
1. [Yellow Belt](yellow): Curiosity  
How to plan solutions to problems, making decisions and how to more easily share your code - with your teacher and with yourself, e.g. at home or on a mobile device
1. [Orange Belt](orange): Determination  
How to collect data together to make it more usable, but also how to be better at fixing problems that occur while writing code. 
1. [Green Belt](green): Growth  
Using functions to understand how to write better code, testing code more thoroughly and using website-based competitions to test yourself.
1. [Blue Belt](blue): Control  
Reading and writing data from and to files, to attack more interesting problems. 
1. [Purple Belt](purple): Strength  
Using your own machine to take control of third party libraries and using other people's code so you don't have to always write your own. 
1. [Brown Belt](brown): Stability  
Introduction to more complex data structures, to allow for BIO questions and presenting data to users in more interesting ways, 
1. [Black Belt](black): Mastery  
You are now a proper programmer, you'll graduate to using real tools and to bring all your skills to bear in producing answers to complicated questions. 
1. [Red Belt](red): Leadership  
You become a teacher, you're helping your peers, spreading the word and telling the school what you want to know.
